PDS_10_Project
Overview
This project is part of the SUST Edge Course on Data Science.
We focus on building a machine learning model to predict temperature based on other variables in the dataset.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

Time

Current

Voltage

Temperature (target variable)

Objective
The main goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate temperature using time, current, and voltage as input features.

Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
